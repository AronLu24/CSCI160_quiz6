Plus Minus:


Time Complexity: The time complexity of this function is O(n), 
where 'n' is the number of elements in the input array 'arr'. The function 
iterates through the array once, performing a constant amount of work for 
each element. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to 
the input size.

Space Complexity: The space complexity of this function is O(1), which means 
it uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input array. 
The function uses a few integer variables to keep track of counts and fractions, 
but the space used for these variables does not depend on the size of the input array.
